# Crash Bash Extractor

This is a quickly-written utility to extract the data file from Crash Bash.

Currently it only supports unpacking.

## Extra

I've also included a ripped song that was unused in Crash Bash (from the early July 26th demo).

You can play it either with a SF2+MIDI player (XMPlay, foobar2000, Falcosoft MIDI Player), or with Winamp (through MS Synth DLS) or through the PSF. PSF was created with the Davironica generic driver, so no looping on the PSF for now.
